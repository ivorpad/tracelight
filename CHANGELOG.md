# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Tracelight is its own VS Code extension (`tracelight/`, id `ivor.tracelight`) for JavaScript and
  TypeScript, with the same panel, Time Machine, Code Story and Debugger. Its commands, settings,
  keybindings, debug type (`"type": "tracelight"`), home (`~/.tracelight`) and CLI shim
  (`~/.local/bin/tracelight`) are its own, so it installs next to Pyokka without a clash. Pyokka is
  Python only again: it no longer activates on, runs or debugs JS/TS files, and no longer ships the
  Node runtime. Both build from the same sources: `node esbuild.mjs --tracelight` (docs/tracelight/README.md).
- Fixed: a JavaScript or TypeScript run never left "running" in VS Code. The Node runtime did not
  send `run.started`, which the extension waits for before it shows a run.
- The Debug Console shows what the program prints during a debug session.
- `tracelight debug FILE` opens `vscode://ivor.tracelight/debug`, and the CLI reads the Tracelight
  extension's sessions from `$TRACELIGHT_HOME/sessions`. HTTP recordings of a JS/TS run go to
  `.tracelight/replay/` (an existing `.pyokka/replay/` keeps being used).
- `pyokka mcp`: the CLI as an MCP server on stdin/stdout for Claude Code, Codex and other MCP
  clients, stdlib JSON-RPC, six tools (`pyokka_run`, `pyokka_map`, `pyokka_step`, `pyokka_value`,
  `pyokka_coverage`, `pyokka_debug`) whose answers are the commands' own text. Add it with
  `claude mcp add pyokka -- pyokka mcp` (README, "As an MCP server").
- `pyokka coverage RUN|--live [--file F]`: per file the statement lines that ran, did not run, ran
  in part or raised; `--file` lists one file line by line with its hits.
- Tracelight, Pyokka in a browser (`docs/WEB.md`): `node dist/web/server.js FILE` serves the panel beside a
  Monaco code pane at http://127.0.0.1:4777/, re-runs the file when it is saved, and runs edits
  typed in the page. `?layout=panel` is the panel alone, for VS Code's Simple Browser next to the
  editor. An agent steps the Time Machine and explains lines in a bubble with
  `node dist/web/server.js ctl step over --say "..."`, the HTTP API behind it, or WebMCP tools. The
  bridge relays the runtime protocol unchanged, so the same page serves any runtime (`--runtime`).
- Tracelight has every view of the panel: Time Machine watches, Variable History and Why, the
  Execution Diagram, HTTP record/replay, Narrate and the Tour (through `claude`, `codex` or
  `TRACELIGHT_EXPLAIN_COMMAND`), and the live Debugger with gutter breakpoints and its controls
  under the code. Agents get `ctl var`, `why`, `watch`, `break` and `debug`, and the matching
  WebMCP tools.
- Tracelight also has what VS Code opens as editors: the Code Story in the code pane, following
  the Time Machine; Profile, as a table of the hottest functions with the `.cpuprofile` at
  `/api/profile`; Show Instrumented File; Show Logs. The Settings view's run modes work (On Save,
  On Demand), and View Recent Files switches the page to another file the bridge ran. Agents get
  `ctl story` and `ctl profile`.
- Tracelight records inside `worker_threads`, including `eval: true` workers and workers that workers start:
  a worker's steps, scopes, locals, `// ?` logs and coverage land in the same trace as the main thread's,
  merged in a causally valid order (every message sent before it is received), with no cost per statement.
  Each worker scope carries `thread: {name, ident}`, and a value a worker logged expands, from the live
  worker or from a snapshot taken when it exits. `workers: false` in the run config runs workers as they are.
- Tracelight: the trace of a run with workers streams while they run instead of arriving at the end, and the
  debugger records workers too: a pause anywhere lands on the right step of the merged trace, and line and
  function breakpoints and step into / over / out work inside worker code.
- Tracelight: an error raised by a loop header after its body ran (a `for-of` item that fails to destructure,
  a throwing iterator) names a new step on the header, and a JS/TS module block in Code Story no longer
  starts at a function's closing brace.
- The JavaScript / TypeScript runtime is named Tracelight: the CLI is `tracelight` (`node/bin/tracelight.mjs`,
  `tracelight mcp`), its environment variables start with `TRACELIGHT_`, its cache lives in `~/.tracelight/`
  and its docs in `docs/tracelight/`. The extension installs a `tracelight` command next to `pyokka` and removes
  the old `pyokka-js` one it wrote. The Python runtime and the extension keep the Pyokka name.
- JavaScript and TypeScript in the editor: Value Peek hovers, snaps (`/*{{ … }}*/`, output as
  `//» `), quick install of a missing npm package with the project's package manager, the Start
  button, New JavaScript/TypeScript File, snippets, Select Node.js, Clear Library Cache for the JS
  cache, JS value syntax in the panel (`null`, `true`), and the Debugger runs a `.js`/`.ts` file on
  Node instead of Python. Also for JS/TS: `≈` values on edited lines, the Code Story coloured as
  TypeScript, a TypeScript demo on the start view, and the Tour (built by Tracelight's own `tour` verb, so no Python is needed).

## 0.3.0

- The band checks a proposed fix on a copy in `.pyokka/band-tmp/` next to the program instead of
  `/tmp/pyokka-band/`, which does not exist on Windows.
- The untrusted-workspace setting's choices and the selection toggle said Quokka; they say Pyokka.
- The repository has a `LICENSE` (MIT). Quokka's docs, screenshots and manifest copied for research
  are no longer tracked, and the README says Pyokka is inspired by Quokka.js, not a port of it.
- `examples/rrf/`: the RRF demo and its FastAPI service, used by the skill's evals.
- The Pyokka band, a Claude Code plugin in `claude-plugin/pyokka-band`: the Time Machine of a VS
  Code session above the Claude Code prompt (code, values, stack, a short explanation, the run's
  bugs), `/pk` keys, fix plans in `.pyokka/findings/`, and a `band` tool for the agent. Install with
  `claude plugin marketplace add ivorpad/pyokka` and `claude plugin install pyokka-band@pyokka`
  (README, "In Claude Code"). The skill shows it when an agent steps through a run with a person.

## 0.2.0

- `pyokka tour RUN|--live [--goal NAME|FILE:LINE] [--budget TOKENS] [--json]`: a run split into
  chapters, and per chapter the steps worth a stop, each with the signals that proposed it and the
  values the program held there, every value from the recording. Chapters are the calls the
  top-level frame makes, and inside a call over 25% of the run one phase per project function its
  orchestrator calls, never cut while concurrent tasks run: on the PageIndex run (23,567 steps)
  the six phases of the published tour, to the step. Signals: `why` back from the output (or
  `--goal`), callbacks from libraries, HTTP requests and where each response lands, file writes
  and subprocesses, raises and rare branch arms, what an orchestrating function keeps, and the
  values sharing the most words with the output. Long values are cut at 300 characters with
  `evidence` windows into the full text, a repeated value is `sameAs` an earlier one, a value
  that grew shows only the part that changed. `--budget` (default 40,000 tokens) keeps the best
  scored candidates in an equal share per chapter. A run with under 60 walkthrough moments is one
  chapter of its moments. 0.8 s on the PageIndex run; schema and rules in `docs/TOUR.md`.

- TOUR section in the panel's Output view, under WALKTHROUGH ("Pyokka: Show Tour"). While it is
  open, each finished run gets its tour from the Python `pyokka tour` (the host writes the
  session's recording to a temporary `run.json` and runs the command with the session's
  interpreter; 83 ms on a 243-step run). It shows the chapter map (title, step range, LLM calls),
  the chapters as folding groups with only the Time Machine's chapter open, and the stops as rows:
  title, `file:line · function · #step`, one value cut to 80 characters, the rest folded. A click
  moves the Time Machine to the stop; the stop nearest the current step is marked "you are here";
  the last clicked stop is remembered per file (by the candidate's `key`, so a re-run finds the
  same statement) and the section reopens there. "Narrate Tour" (the sparkle, or the command) makes
  one model call through Narrate's backends (`pyokka.explain.command`, `claude -p`, `codex exec`,
  Copilot) with `skills/pyokka/references/tour-prompt.md` and the redacted tour, then validates
  and merges the answer with `pyokka tour --prose`; never automatic, cached per run, and a refused
  answer shows its violations once. When the run recorded no variable changes (the editor's
  default) the section says so in one line: on `tour_small.py` that tour has 11 stops against 16
  with them, since repeated calls carry no arguments to tell them apart. Its link turns Record
  Variable Changes on and runs the file once.

- Bridge: a `recording` request returns the session's run as a saved run's `{meta, events}`, which
  is how `tour --live` runs the saved-run code over an open session.

- `walkthrough` and `why` are faster on long runs: a long scope no longer scans each of its steps
  for log entries, and the statement table behind `var` and `why` splits a file's source once
  instead of once per call. On the PageIndex run (23,567 steps) a walkthrough took 1.5 s and takes
  0.8 s, one `why` 0.35 s and 0.07 s; the output is byte for byte the same.

- A saved run whose files are gone reads the copy of each file it kept, so a run moved to another
  machine still shows its source.

- `history`: a value on a card is as long as the run kept it. Cards were cut at 200 characters
  whatever the run held, so a PageIndex page text recorded with `--max-value-chars 4000` showed 218
  of its 3,261 characters. `--value-chars N` cuts shorter; 0 shows every value whole. `--prose`
  accepts a checkpoint's `evidence` links, a JSON list, as `code-history.md` documents; it refused
  them as a field that comes from the run.

- `diff` prints the lines of an edited statement that changed. A multi-line call edited on its
  third line printed `- scores = rrf( …` and `+ scores = rrf( …`, the same text on both sides; it
  now prints `    scores = rrf( …`, `  - k=60,`, `  + k=1,`. A long line is shown from shortly
  before its first differing character. `--json` adds `sourceA`/`sourceB` to edited statements.

- `diff` ignores the memory address in an object's repr. `<function dataclass at 0x101d10720>`
  against `0x101908720` was reported as a changed value of `from dataclasses import dataclass`,
  and was the "first difference" of every run pair that imports a function.

- `walkthrough` and `why`: a lambda or generator expression shows no `out`. With Auto Log on (every
  VS Code session) the `<lambda>` sort keys of `ranked = sorted(..., key=lambda kv: kv[1])` took
  the value logged on that statement, the whole sorted list, as their own result. Saved runs and
  live sessions now agree.

- `walkthrough`: a call's `endStep` is the last step of the call or of anything it called, so a
  function that ends in `return f(x)` ends after `f` ran. `PageIndexClient.chat_completions`
  ended at #22293, its `return run_chat_completions(...)`, while its work ran to #23559.

- `walkthrough`: a function the program's own code did not call by name (a LangGraph node, an
  agents SDK tool, called from library code that is not recorded) is a `tool` moment at its own
  entry step, "callback into classify from ask", with `callerScopeId` naming the function that was
  running. They were filed as calls from the statement at the top of the program that started the
  library: every LangGraph node at `main()` (#18), every PageIndex tool at `client.chat(...)`
  (#22178). The execution graph draws the edge from that caller too.

- `http`: concurrent requests (an `asyncio.gather` of tasks that each make one) carry the step of
  the statement in the task that issued each one. They all carried the step of the last task to
  reach that line, so 13 PageIndex leaf summaries shared one step (#15050).

- `PYOKKA_HOME` moves everything Pyokka keeps under `~/.pyokka` (session descriptors and
  sockets, `last-debug.json`, the library cache, recent files, `config.json`). The extension and
  the CLI resolve it the same way, and the extension passes it to the runners it starts. A
  session socket whose path would exceed the 103-byte macOS limit goes to the temp directory.
  The e2e suite runs with a fresh `PYOKKA_HOME` under `/tmp`, so it no longer sees the sessions
  of an open VS Code window.
- A recording no longer loses data without saying so. A run past the step cap (999,999) prints a
  `WARNING: recording truncated` with the steps it ran, the three files that spent them and the
  `--exclude` to rerun with; `state` and every other verb over that run start with a `note:` line,
  `--json` gets `recording`, and the Time Machine says it under its timeline. `run --max-steps N`
  sets the cap (`pyokka.maxTraceSteps` in VS Code).
- `pyokka run --exclude GLOB` and `--only GLOB` (repeatable; dotted modules or path globs) leave code
  out of the recording: it runs at full speed and records nothing. VS Code:
  `pyokka.timeMachine.exclude`.
- A recorded value cut at its length limit ends in `…(+N chars)` everywhere it is printed, and
  `--json` carries `truncated: true, length: N`. `run --max-value-chars N` (or `pyokka.maxValueChars`)
  keeps more; 0 keeps the whole value up to 1,000,000 characters. A function's return value follows
  the same limit and mark (the scope gets `returnedTruncated` and `returnedLength`), so a function
  returning a 10,000-character prompt shows `returned 'xxx…(+9,882 chars)'` in `context`, the
  `out` row of `walkthrough` and `graph`, and `diff`, where it used to stop at 120 characters with
  a bare `…`.
- `pyokka run` runs the program under the project's Python: `--python PATH`, `$PYOKKA_PYTHON`,
  `$VIRTUAL_ENV`, or a `.venv` next to the file or above it up to the git root, with the runtime put
  on its `PYTHONPATH`. The first line of `run` names the interpreter.

- HTTP record, replay and the HTTP view see async clients. httpx is hooked where the client picks
  its transport, so `AsyncClient` and custom transports count, litellm's aiohttp-backed one
  included; aiohttp's `ClientSession` is hooked directly, streamed bodies reaching the program as
  they arrive. A litellm program making 1 sync and 6 async calls (5 concurrent, 1 streamed) listed
  1 request before and 7 now, and replays all 7 with no network.
- Every function exit records what it returned, on the trace's scope (`returned`, or `raised` with
  the exception type): `return f(x)` inside `try`, `return await …`, returns inside `with` and
  `finally`, a generator's return value. `walkthrough`, `graph` and the panel's call list read it,
  so a call's `out` is its own value instead of a value logged near it (with `--auto-log`,
  `return helper(x) + 1` used to give helper the caller's value). `context` ends the block line
  with `returned VALUE` and lists the statement's calls with theirs. Cost on a recorded loop of
  100,000 iterations and 300,000 returns: 0.80 s to 0.92 s returning ints, 0.81 s to 1.20 s
  returning small dicts; with locals recording on, 1.84 s to 1.94 s.
- The Pyokka panel and Show Output / Focus Output are there with no session. The empty panel has
  two buttons, Start on current file and Debug current file.
- `pyokka history --lang es` gives a page in Spanish: the buttons, legend, chips and card labels
  follow `lang` (`en` or `es`; any other language gets English).
- `pyokka diff before.json after.json` (or `diff before.json --live`) lists what an edit changed,
  statement by statement: assigned values, branch arms, loop counts, calls with their arguments,
  prints and raises, each with both runs' step numbers. Statements pair by their text, so lines
  the edit moved still match. A saved run now keeps a redacted copy of the user's files
  (`meta.files[].source`) so the run from before the edit still has the text that ran.
- `pyokka debug FILE --record-from NAME` (or `FILE:LINE`) records from a pause on: the code before
  it runs at the debugger's speed (a 1,000,000-iteration loop before the breakpoint took 1.17x to
  1.19x a `record: false` run, against about 9x with `--record`), and the pause becomes step 0 of a
  recording that the Time Machine, `why --live`, `var --live` and `history --live` read. Coverage
  covers the whole run. A `why` chain that reaches a value made before the pause ends with `made
  before #0, where the recording started`. `pyokka record --live` at an earlier pause of the same
  run starts the recording there.
- One control surface: the side bar is this moment, the bottom panel is the whole run. The Time
  Machine is a VS Code debug session in replay, so the Run and Debug side bar is no longer empty
  next to it: Call Stack and Variables show the recording at the current step, Watch and hovers
  answer recorded names, Step Back and Reverse Continue sit on the debug toolbar, and clicking a
  caller frame moves to the step that called it. Every move, from the toolbar, the panel, the Code
  Story or `pyokka step --live`, moves the same Time Machine. A `"record": true` debug session
  replays behind its frontier the same way instead of opening a second session.
- The panel drops what the side bar now shows: the Time Machine's CALL STACK and STEP VARIABLES,
  the Debugger view's CALL STACK and LOCALS, and every step, Continue, Pause and Stop button in the
  panel and its title bar. Output, watches, breakpoints, the timeline, ENTRIES and DETAILS, the
  diagram and the story stay. Why This Value moved to the Variables view's context menu.

## 0.1.6

- `--at` repeats on `pyokka debug` and `break --live`: `pyokka debug app.py --at load --at clean
  --at score` sets every stop before the program starts, and `continue --live` walks them in run
  order, across files. The relaunch memory keeps all of them.
- `break --live --remove NAME` removes the function breakpoint `--at NAME` made; before, only a
  `FILE:LINE` could be removed, so an `--at NAME` stayed in the Breakpoints view for good.
- `pyokka debug FILE --record` from a terminal no longer times out: the CLI waited for a debug
  session's descriptor, and a recording one is a run session. It now attaches at the first pause.
  The file opens in an editor too, since a recording session ends with its document.
- A `continue` that runs a recording session to its end answers `finished` instead of `stopped
  answering`: the session's socket waits for the reply it owes before closing.

## 0.1.5

- The debugger needs fewer steps from an agent. `continue --live`, `break --live FILE:LINE` and
  `restart --live` with no debug session start the last `pyokka debug` launch from that directory
  again (remembered in `~/.pyokka/last-debug.json`) and print its first stop, with a first line
  naming what they re-ran, since re-running repeats the program's side effects. `--no-start`
  refuses instead. With nothing remembered, the error now says to start one with
  `pyokka debug FILE --at NAME` rather than to open the file in VS Code.
- With `pyokka.agentAccess` off, a `pyokka debug` from an agent asks in VS Code whether to allow
  agents. Allow turns the setting on and starts that same launch; before, it showed a warning and
  the launch was lost.
- A Debugger pause shows values in the editor: each line of the paused function, up to the
  stopped one, gets `name = value` for the names the frame holds, read from the frame through VS
  Code's inline values. Nothing is recorded for it, so a run of a million steps costs nothing more.
- A cold `pyokka debug` brings the VS Code window to the front at the first stop (`code --goto`),
  because the CLI runs in a terminal and the editor otherwise moves behind it. `--no-focus` or
  `PYOKKA_NO_FOCUS=1` turns it off.
- The skill's `debug` mode starts with `pyokka debug`, never with `break --live`, says when a verb
  re-ran the program, and uses `--record` when the user wants the program's history in the editor.

- One skill, `skills/pyokka`, replaces `pyokka-show-me`, `explain-code` and the `pyokka-agent` and
  `pyokka-debug` pointers. The first argument picks the mode: `/pyokka debug` pauses and steps a
  running program and answers in chat, `/pyokka explain` walks a person through a run in their
  editor, `/pyokka show` investigates and hands over a code-history page. `SKILL.md` routes and holds
  what every mode shares (finding the runtime, sessions, staying out of the user's project,
  cleaning up); each mode's workflow is in `references/debug.md`, `explain.md` or `show.md`, so a
  mode loads only its own. Installs that symlinked the old directories need one link to
  `skills/pyokka` instead.

- `explain-code/pyokka.sh` works in a copy of the skill made by hand: with no Pyokka checkout next
  to it, it runs the `pyokka` the extension keeps on PATH or in `~/.local/bin`.
- The code-history renderer needs no `npm install`. Handlebars and Shiki (Python, the default
  theme, the JavaScript regex engine) are bundled in `skills/pyokka-show-me/scripts/render-deps.cjs`,
  346 KB, and give the same tokens as the full Shiki. The page still opens offline. Another
  `--theme` needs a full Shiki, looked for in `~/.cache/pyokka/render` as well as the working
  directory. `node scripts/build-render-deps.mjs` rebuilds the bundle.
- The show-me skill reads "step", "break" and "test the debugger" as the live debugger even under
  `$pyokka-agent`, answers a check in chat instead of building a page, never builds harnesses or
  edits config in the user's project, treats `0 steps` with `exit None` as a failed runner (a
  sandbox `PermissionError`), and cleans up its breakpoints before reporting.

## 0.1.4

- `pyokka` on PATH without knowing where the extension lives. With `pyokka.agentAccess` on, the
  extension writes `~/.local/bin/pyokka`, a shell script that runs its own `dist/python` runtime,
  and rewrites it on every activation, so a path an agent saved from an older version can no longer
  go stale (`No module named pyokka_runtime` from a `ivor.pyokka-0.0.1` path on a 0.1.3 install). The
  script picks `$PYOKKA_PYTHON`, then an activated venv, then the window's interpreter, and exports
  the editor's own launcher as `$PYOKKA_CODE` when the caller set none, which covers a machine with
  no `code` on PATH. It never touches a file it did not write: a `uv tool install` symlink at that
  path stays. It needs no admin rights. When `~/.local/bin` is not on PATH (a stock macOS), the
  extension offers once to add it to `~/.zprofile` or the bash profile, and copies the line instead
  when the profile cannot be written. Not on Windows. With several editors open, the last window to
  activate wins.
- The show-me skill finds the runtime and the launcher on the current machine, counts the debugger
  ready only at an observed pause in the intended code, tracks the breakpoints it adds, keeps
  `--session` throughout, launches pytest with `--assert=plain`, and uses `history --append`.

## 0.1.3

- The show-me skill says where a live step starts from. `pyokka step --live --into` moves from the
  window's current Time Machine step, not from wherever the previous command left the cursor, and
  the human moves that step too: the Code Story, the panel's timeline and the Time Machine controls
  all jump it. A sequence that had reached step 4 therefore landed at 19, because the window had
  gone to 18 in between, and nothing in the output said so. The skill now states the rule, names the
  tell (a landing the previous stop's `moves:` line did not offer) and documents
  `step --live 18 --into`, which goes to 18 first and moves from there. Only `--json` echoes the
  `from` it started at; the text form still does not. No extension code changed in this release, so
  the vsix is the v0.1.2 build under a new number.

## 0.1.2

- `git push` works on its own after a release. The publish step used `git push origin HEAD`, which
  sends the branch but sets no upstream, so a bare `git push` in the checkout afterwards had nothing
  to push to and had to be told the remote and branch by hand. It is `git push -u origin HEAD` now,
  and the first release sets the tracking the rest of them rely on.

## 0.1.1

- The vsix stops shipping the session notes. Packaging v0.1.0 listed its contents and `handoffs/`
  was in them, 32 KB of working notes that `.gitignore` keeps out of the repo and `.vscodeignore`
  had never been told about, alongside `.pytest_cache/` and the e2e launcher config. Every build
  back to 0.0.1 had carried them into the extension folder of whatever machine installed it. The
  four are excluded now, and `vsce ls` reports the package as `dist`, `media`, `snippets`,
  `syntaxes`, `examples` and the three top-level documents, nothing else.

## 0.1.0

- A build moves the version, and a release puts the vsix on GitHub. Four files carried the number
  0.0.1 and nothing ever moved them, so every build overwrote `pyokka-0.0.1.vsix` and an installed
  extension could not be told apart from the one before it. `scripts/version.py` is now the only
  thing that writes them and it writes all four together, `package.json` deciding and the manifest
  generator's fallback literal included, which left stale would have regenerated 0.0.1 again the
  next time anyone deleted the manifest. The level comes from a `Bump:` trailer on the commits since
  the last tag, patch when none of them says otherwise, so subject lines stay prose and the trailer
  sits where `git log --oneline` does not show it; `.githooks/commit-msg` rejects a misspelled level
  rather than letting it fall back to patch and ship the wrong number. The next version is computed
  from the tag rather than from the current number, which is what makes five builds before a commit
  land on one new number instead of walking five, while a commit that later carries `Bump: minor`
  still escalates that same pending release. A `PreToolUse(Bash)` hook,
  `.claude/hooks/bump-version.sh`, bumps ahead of any command that packages or installs, because a
  hook cannot rewrite the command and a bump after the build would stamp the artifact with the
  previous release's number. `scripts/release.sh` runs the whole pass: checks first so a failure
  leaves the tree clean, then bump, cut `## Unreleased` into a `## X.Y.Z` section, build, install,
  annotated tag, push, and `gh release create` with the vsix attached. Releases go to a private
  `ivorpad/pyokka`, and the cut changelog section is the release body, so the notes are the ones
  written while the work happened rather than a list of commit subjects assembled afterwards.

- What an agent reads at a debug stop is bounded by the code, not by three round numbers. All three
  boundaries in the stop reply were drawn by counting: the output was the last 4000 characters of
  everything the program had ever printed, the block was 60 lines centred on the pause, and the
  frame chain dropped every frame Pyokka had not instrumented. The last was the worst. The
  `http.server` fixture pauses in a handler eight frames below `serve_forever`, and the reply said
  `do_GET` and then stopped: a chain the program never had, with nothing saying frames were
  missing. Runs of frames with no source are now folded where they stand into
  `{elided: 8, where: "library", in: ["http/server.py", "socketserver.py", "threading.py"]}`, which
  can name the files because an uninstrumented frame now sends its own `path`. The block keeps the
  signature however far down the function the pause is and spends the rest of its budget on the
  suite the paused line is in (the loop body, whole) instead of a window that can open on the tail
  of one statement and close on the head of another; it carries `totalLines`, and the CLI prints
  `… 299 lines` at each gap rather than a bare ellipsis. `output` is now what the program printed
  since the previous stop: an agent stepping ten times was reading the same 4 KB ten times and
  could never tell which line its own step produced. It reads `output (2 new lines; 412 earlier)`,
  or `output: nothing new since the last stop`, with `seq` and `earlier` placing the delta in the
  run; `--scope` and `state --live` still answer with the whole 64 KB window. The cursor sits on
  the session, not the connection, because the CLI opens one per command, and re-reading a stop
  shows its delta again instead of eating it. Watched against running programs, not fixtures
  (`test/e2e/debug-live.test.js`, `test/e2e/debug-server.test.js`).

- A failed `--live` command says which session took it. When no session of the kind a verb wants is
  open, the CLI serves it from the other product, which is usually right: `debug --live` asks a
  recording session's window to launch. When the command then fails, the host answers about the
  session it landed in and never says a different one was wanted, so `continue --live` after a
  debug run has ended reports `no debug run in progress` from a window you were not asking about,
  and the only way to see the substitution was to read `~/.pyokka/sessions` by hand. The hint now
  carries it: `no debug session here: this is the run session on api/main.py. \`pyokka debug FILE\`
  starts one.` A session named outright, or one that is the kind the verb asked for, stays quiet.

- The Debugger view uses the width it is given. It was built to the shape of VS Code's Run and
  Debug sidebar, a single narrow column of 22px rows, but it is contributed to `panel`, where it is
  as wide as the editor: every row used about a quarter of that, and LOCALS truncated a long repr
  with 1500 px of empty space beside it. Past 900 px the pause context takes the left column and
  output the right. The rule is a container query, so it follows the panel the user drags rather
  than the window, and narrower the columns stack into the single column the view has always been,
  with output leading while the program runs. Clocks are printed where they change instead of on
  every row: a `print()` of ten lines arrives as one chunk with one timestamp, so ten copies of
  `1m 07s` ran down the gutter and read as noise, and where the clock does change it marks where a
  burst began. The watch add form can now make the watches it never could. It called
  `onWatchAdd(exp)` and dropped the second argument, so `+` only ever made a displayed watch
  however it was meant, and break-when was reachable from the CLI alone; a mode names the two kinds
  the way `--break-when true|change` already does.

- The Debugger view works while the program is running, not only after it stops. It was built for
  the moment after a pause: with `stack` empty unless paused, `LOCALS` gated on `paused` and every
  watch reading `no value at this stop`, four of its five sections were dead for the whole length of
  a run — and the one that was not sat last, capped at 320 px, and never scrolled, so the tail ran
  off the bottom while you watched a stale window. An agent script is almost never paused: a run of
  the travel-concierge cookbook takes forty-odd seconds, fourteen of them printing nothing at all.
  Now the sections are ordered by what is live — output leads and takes the free space while the
  program runs, stack and locals lead at a stop — the pane follows its tail and parks when you
  scroll up (the `atBottom` rule the run-all list has always had), and a watch says `at the next
  pause`, which is what is actually true. An activity row above the pane answers what a spinner
  cannot: elapsed, bytes printed, how long ago the last byte came, and a trace of characters per
  half second. Every figure is measured from what the host already had. Sampling the top frame while
  running would be the most useful line in that row and is deliberately not there — it needs the
  hook to report a frame without stopping the program, which is its own question — and watches are
  still not evaluated mid-run, because that runs program code at an arbitrary point, which is what
  run-all is for.

- Output carries the stream it came from, when it arrived, and its colour. The runtime always sent
  `stream` on every write and `appendOutput` threw it away, so httpx's INFO logs and a traceback
  were indistinguishable from the program's answer; stderr now keeps its own colour and can be
  hidden. Rows are stamped with when they arrived, a silence longer than three seconds is drawn
  between the rows either side of it, and the head the 64 KB window cut is a marker rather than a
  note in the section header. ANSI escapes were printed as literal text — nothing in the webview
  decoded them — so rich and colorama wrote `ESC[2m ESC[36m` into the pane; SGR now resolves to
  VS Code's own `terminal.ansi*` colours, and a `\r` repaint shows the last frame the way a terminal
  shows a progress bar rather than every step of it. The line the program is still writing is marked
  as open, which is what `print(delta, end="")` produces: the old tail kept the last 500 *lines*, and
  a token stream is one line however long it runs, so the window did nothing and the 64 KB cut landed
  mid-token.

- The panel is sent the output that is new, not all of it, ten times a second. `state()` put the
  whole 64 KB window in every push and `scheduleOutput` pushed every 100 ms, so the cost was
  O(buffer) per tick with a `redact()` pass over text the view already had. `debug.output.append`
  carries only what the view has not seen; when a delta does not continue where the view left off it
  asks for a full `debug.session` and the host resends, so the existing message stays the initial
  sync and the recovery path and nothing about the first paint changes.

- A secret is no longer at risk of being missed when it straddles two writes, and a long line no
  longer wedges the extension host. `redact()` matches whole tokens and `key: value` pairs, so it
  only catches a split secret if it sees both halves at once — which the old whole-buffer rescan got
  for free and a delta does not. A line is now redacted when it completes, with the end of the
  previous line as context (`password:` on one line still reaches its value on the next), and the
  incomplete trailing line is redacted afresh and sent whole every time rather than as a delta.
  Separately, `redact()` backtracks quadratically in the length of what it is handed: 64 KB on one
  line costs about 2.4 s against 0.3 ms for the same bytes as short lines, and the shipped code ran
  it over the whole buffer every 100 ms — so a program printing one very long line, which is exactly
  what token streaming is, could hang the host. It is never handed more than a kilobyte at once now,
  with the end of each redacted slice carried into the next as context.

- A command served by the other product says so when it fails. Only one kind of session may be
  open, so a debug verb is answered by a recording session (and the reverse), which is usually what
  you want: `pyokka debug FILE` asks a recording session's own window to launch. When the command
  then fails, the host's reply describes the session that took it and cannot know a different kind
  was wanted, so `continue --live` after a debug run ended reads as `no debug run in progress` from
  a window nobody asked about. The hint now carries `no debug session here: this is the run session
  on api/main.py. \`pyokka debug FILE\` starts one.` Nothing changes about which session is chosen,
  and a session named outright with `--session` is a choice rather than a substitution, so it stays
  quiet.

- `var` and `why` say `(same object)` where they said `(unchanged)`. The change marker for a
  local is `(id(value), len(value))`, so `scores[document_id] = scores.get(document_id, 0) + c`
  on a key that is already there keeps both, records no change, and the value shown is the one
  from before the statement. `(unchanged)` asserted that the program had not changed it, which
  was false; `(same object)` says what was actually observed, and for a scalar it means the same
  thing it always did. Reproduce on the RRF demo at #84, #96 and #102. Folding item identities
  into the marker fixes the detection and costs 131% more wall time on a locals-heavy loop
  (measured, 6-key dict over 20,000 iterations), so the real fix is for the instrumenter to say
  which names a statement assigns and scan only those; `docs/HANDOFF.md` has the measurement and
  the plan.

- An agent explains through a generated page, not a typed one. `pyokka history RUN --at STEP`,
  `--at FILE:LINE`, `--var NAME`, `--why STEP NAME` and `--live --pause` write the data behind a
  two-panel code-history page: numbered source left, chronological checkpoints right, dim
  context, green lines that ran, amber current line and values. Every selector is a call on the
  same `RunSource` seam `context`, `var` and `why` use, so every value on the page is what
  `pyokka context RUN N --json` prints and every checkpoint carries that command in `verify`. A
  checkpoint also carries the step number, the `in` and `out` of a call at its line, the line's
  hit count, and the arm a branch took across every pass (`took False x2, True x1`, rather than
  whichever pass the walkthrough listed last), which is what a one-frame debugger cannot show.
  Prose (`heading`, `summary`, `title`, `text`, `note`) is left empty and merged from
  `--prose PATH` keyed by checkpoint id; a prose file that names a generated field fails with
  `prose may not set "values" on step-55`, so the same file survives a re-run and only the
  numbers move. Checkpoints appear in the order the flags were written, through one shared
  argparse action, because a page is a narrative, and `--append` adds a run's checkpoints to the
  page already at `--out`, which is how one page follows a live program through several pauses
  without anyone merging two files by hand. The verb refuses a stale run outright, reports
  what a `--limit` cut in `meta.truncated` instead of dropping it silently, and redacts the
  source lines it puts in the page and names each one, because an HTML file travels further than
  the terminal `pyokka context` already redacts for. Four evidence kinds are kept apart and the
  renderer refuses anything else: `recorded step`, `live pause` (no provenance chain, because a
  `record: false` session recorded nothing behind the pause), `static source` (no values) and
  `gloss`. A live pause is read with `context` alone, which needs no new bridge verb and never
  moves a session the user is looking at. `skills/pyokka-show-me/templates/code-history.html.hbs`
  and `scripts/render-code-history.cjs` render it into one standalone file with no CDN. The
  Python is coloured by Shiki at render time and the page carries the tokens, so a theme costs
  the reader no network; `--theme` takes any bundled theme and the default is
  `github-dark-dimmed`. Handlebars and Shiki (new devDependencies) resolve from the working
  directory, then the skill's own directory, then `--handlebars-module`; without Shiki the page
  still renders, in plain monochrome. The design is `docs/design/show-me.md`.

- One skill for Pyokka. `skills/pyokka-show-me/SKILL.md` is what an agent loads to do anything:
  both products and when each applies, saved run against live and how a session is found, the
  verb table, the three routes of `pyokka debug` and the URI question, `exec` and the modified
  banner, `--library-code`, staleness, secrets, what cannot be done, and one phrase-to-command
  table merging the two that existed. It explains through the code-history page by default, on
  "show me" and without it. `skills/pyokka-agent/SKILL.md` and `skills/pyokka-debug/SKILL.md`
  keep their descriptions, which are what make them trigger, and shrink to pointers: their
  content is now `references/pyokka-cli.md` and `references/live-debugger.md`, one source of
  truth for one CLI. `skills/explain-code/SKILL.md` keeps its method, because explaining to a
  person while the editor follows the stops is a different job from handing over a page.

- The Debugger is its own product. F5, the Run menu, the panel's Debug button, "Pyokka: Debug
  Current File" and `pyokka debug FILE` create a debug session, not a run-all session: it holds
  the launch configuration (`program` or `module`, `args`, `cwd`, `env`, `python`,
  `stopOnEntry`, `breakOnException`, `libraryCode`, `record`), owns a runner child of its own,
  runs the program at full speed and stops at a breakpoint or an exception. Nothing is recorded,
  nothing re-runs, nothing is "finished": when the program exits or Stop is pressed the session
  is gone. No run timeout applies while a debugger is attached, recording or not, so a paused
  server stays paused. An edit while paused is accepted and simply not applied until the next
  start. A file may have a run-all session and a debug session at the same time; they share VS
  Code's gutter breakpoints and nothing else. `"record": true` in a launch configuration is the
  other half: today's recording debug run, with the Time Machine over the recording, reached
  explicitly and never by default. The design is `docs/design/debugger-product.md`.
- The runtime records nothing in debugger mode. `config.record: false` with `config.debug` emits
  `run.started`, `file.instrumented`, `output`, the pause and resume events, the typed replies,
  one `error` for the exception that ended the run and `run.finished`, and never a `trace`, a
  `coverage`, a `log`, a `locals`, a `time`, a `watch` or an `http.exchange`. A second hook set
  (`hooks_debug.py`) costs one integer increment and one list read per statement, a dict lookup
  while a breakpoint is armed, and touches no frame until a reason fires. Step Over and Step Out
  keep nothing per call: `_pk_f` hands out a per-call id and the `_pk_x` the instrumenter already
  calls from a `finally` tells the debugger when the frame it is stepping in has returned. A frame
  that suspends at a `yield` or an `await` lands where it resumes. A Step Over or Step Out whose
  frame exits into code that is not instrumented (a request handler returning into its framework,
  a thread target, a library callback) has no frame of ours to come back to, so it degrades to the
  next statement of the program's own code wherever it runs, the way a debugger with "just my
  code" does; a frame that returns to an instrumented caller or to the module body waits for that
  caller as before. At a function-entry pause frame 0 of the stack reports the `def` line the
  pause reports, so the Call Stack and the editor agree. Measured on a 500,000-iteration loop
  (1,000,003 statements) with one breakpoint set in a function nobody calls, so the lookup runs on
  every statement and never hits, wall time with process start, Python 3.14.6: plain python 0.05
  s, run-all through the runner 1.53 s, the debugger 0.28 s, today's recording debug run 2.59 s;
  on 3.12.9: 0.03 s, 1.01 s, 0.19 s, 2.37 s (`scripts/bench-debug.py`).
- A debug stop shows the real stack. Without a recording `debug.paused.stack` comes from the
  frames themselves, so a caller points at the call and not at its `def` line, a frame outside
  instrumented code is listed with `fileId: 0`, and `frameId` addresses each one: `evaluate`,
  `complete` and the `locals` action take it, the Call Stack view lists every frame with its own
  line and scopes Variables to the selected one, and `locals --live --frame N` / `eval --live EXPR
  --frame N` read a caller frame. Every pause in both modes names its thread as `thread: {name,
  ident}`.
- Servers pause in their handlers. A breakpoint in a request handler stops when a request
  arrives, `continue` answers it, and two requests in flight pause one after the other with a
  `debug.resumed` between them: exactly one thread is paused at a time, so no command takes a
  thread argument. `pause` while the only thread sits in `accept()` answers `{ok, paused: false}`
  and the stop arrives with the next request. `continue --live --no-wait` resumes without waiting
  for the next stop and `pause --live --no-wait` asks for a pause without waiting for it, which is
  what an agent wants against a server. Uvicorn's `--reload` and Flask's `--debug` run the code in
  a worker the debugger never sees; the README says to drop the flag.
- A run can be a module. `run.module` does what `python -m` does (`sys.argv[0]` is the module's
  file, the cwd goes on the front of `sys.path`, the module runs as `__main__`, a package runs its
  `__main__`), and `launch.json` offers three shapes: a file, a file with recording, and a module
  with arguments.
- A Debugger view in the panel, separate from the Time Machine view: laid out like VS Code's own
  debug panes. A status row names why the program paused (an icon per reason, `api/main.py:52` as
  a link that reveals the line, the reason as a chip, the thread at the right), then pane headers
  with counts: CALL STACK (the current frame highlighted, a click reveals a frame and scopes the
  variables and `eval` to it, two or more consecutive library frames folded into `3 frames in
  library code`), LOCALS with the scope in the header and a chevron that opens a value's members,
  WATCHES (a `+` reveals the input; each row shows its `break when true` or `break on change`
  badge), BREAKPOINTS with the pause-on dropdown in the header (red dot for a resolved one, hollow
  for one the runtime has not resolved, and two or more in a file the run never instrumented
  collapsed into one line, `4 in demo.py, not in this run`), and OUTPUT as the program prints. A
  write from the console shows as a warning banner, an exception as an error banner. Continue,
  Pause, Step Over, Step Into, Step Out, Restart and Stop sit in the panel's title while the view
  is showing, and a second status bar item reads `Debugger: paused at app.py:42 (breakpoint)` or
  `Debugger: running`. Starting a debug session brings the panel to the Debugger view under the
  same `pyokka.showOutputOnStart` a run obeys, with the caret left in the editor; the launch row
  shows paths relative to the workspace. The Time Machine view is untouched and still shows a
  recording debug session.
- `pyokka debug app.py` starts a debug session from a terminal and prints the first stop; a file
  or `--module M` implies `--live`. It takes `--args ...` (everything after it goes to the
  program), `--cwd DIR`, `--env K=V`, `--python PATH`, `--at FILE:LINE`, `--stop-on-entry` and
  `--library-code` (step into and pause inside third-party packages too; off by default). The
  launch line of `state --live`, the status bar tooltip and the Debugger view name the interpreter
  the session actually runs, and `library code: on` when it is. Three routes are tried in order: a
  debug session of the file that already exists (its pause is printed, so "start the debugger"
  twice never loses it), a Pyokka session on the file (that window starts the debug session, no
  URI needed), else `code --open-url` with a `vscode://ivor.pyokka/debug?…` URI the window answers
  through a URI handler (activation event `onUri`), after which the CLI polls `~/.pyokka/sessions`
  for up to 20 s. A debug session's bridge socket obeys `pyokka.agentAccess` exactly as a run-all
  session's does, and with the setting off the URI is refused with a warning naming it. The first
  URI also needs a click: VS Code asks whether to let Pyokka open it and waits, so the CLI can
  time out while the question is on screen; Open starts the session however late, `pyokka state
  --live` then finds it, and `ivor.pyokka` in `extensions.confirmedUriHandlerExtensionIds` stops
  the question. The CLI's timeout message says so first, then names the setting. `$PYOKKA_CODE`
  overrides which `code` binary is used.
- Two kinds of bridge descriptor. Run-all descriptors gain `"kind": "run"`; a debug session
  writes `"kind": "debug"` with a `launch` object. The CLI prefers by verb: `debug`, `continue`,
  `pause`, `stop`, `restart`, `break`, `watches`, `locals` and the executing `step` kinds pick the
  debug socket, `why`, `var`, `story`, `walkthrough`, `graph`, `exceptions`, `http`, `values`,
  `find` and `steps` pick the run socket, and `state --live` lists both sessions of a file with
  the debug one first and `[this]` on the one it is connected to. The verbs that read a recording
  are refused on a debug session with `<verb> needs a recording`, and so are the backward moves
  of `step`.
- Exception tracking without a recording keeps nothing. The first sighting of an exception is
  remembered by identity alone (the last 256 exception objects), and with `breakOnException:
  "off"` a non-recording run installs no `sys.monitoring` callbacks at all; the `exceptions`
  action installs and removes them in flight.
- The Debug Console runs statements. `context: "repl"` is an `exec`: `rank = 3`, `items.pop()`,
  `import json`, a `del`, a multi-line block all run in the paused frame, and the value of a last
  expression statement comes back the way a REPL shows it, masked like every other value and with
  a bag the Variables view can open. The write reaches the program's own variables: at module
  level it lands in the module dict, on Python 3.13 and later in the frame's write-through locals
  (PEP 667), on 3.12 through `PyFrame_LocalsToFast`. A name the function declares is read back by
  its code when it continues; a brand-new name stays readable through the console, `eval` and
  `locals`, but the compiled code has no slot for it. A statement that raises is not a failed
  request: its type, message and traceback come back, the console prints `ZeroDivisionError:
  division by zero`, and the program stays paused where it was. Editing a row in the Variables
  view is the same `exec` of `name = value` through `setVariable`. Hovers, the Watch pane,
  break-when watches, breakpoint conditions, `eval` and completions keep going through the pure
  evaluator and cannot write.
- Once anything has been executed the session says so until the next run: `modified: true` rides
  on every later `debug.paused` and on every `locals` reply, the CLI's stop line gains ` (values
  modified from the console)`, the Debugger view shows a banner and the status bar tooltip repeats
  it. Any attempt sets it, a statement that raised included, because one that raised halfway may
  already have written.
- `exec` needs a frame, so it is served only while the program is paused, in both modes, over the
  runner (`exec` request, `executed` reply, capability `exec`) and over both bridge sockets. While
  the program runs the answer is `the program is running; pause it first`; after it has ended,
  `the run has ended; there is no frame to execute in`, rather than the finished run's namespace
  that `evaluate` falls back to. `pyokka exec --live 'rank = 3'` is the agent's form, `--frame N`
  for a caller's frame: an expression prints its value, a statement prints `ok`, a raise prints
  the error on stderr with exit code 0 and `still paused at app.py:42` on stdout, and source that
  does not compile is a failed command (`SyntaxError`, exit 2).
- A breakpoint can name a function. `{function: NAME}` in a breakpoint spec, `--at rrf` on `pyokka
  debug` and on `break --live`, and `setFunctionBreakpoints` from VS Code's Breakpoints view (the
  CLI's function breakpoints are mirrored there too) pause at every call, before the function's
  first statement. The runtime resolves the name as each file is instrumented, so a module
  imported later gets its breakpoint when it loads, which an AST scan of the file could not do,
  and the echo reports the file and the `def` line it landed on. `Ranker.rank` matches the method
  `rank`; the class is not checked. When a second file defines the name the first keeps the
  breakpoint and the echo says `also defined in lib/rank.py:2; give FILE:LINE to pick one`.
- Three moves save an agent a round trip each. `continue --live --to demo.py:82` runs to a line
  through the run-to-line breakpoint the pause already has; `continue --live --until 'rank == 3'`
  installs a break-when watch for that one resume and removes it after the stop, or after the run
  ends instead; `step --live --over --count 3` takes three stops and prints the last, and when a
  breakpoint, a watch or an exception wins on the way the reply says after how many steps
  (`stoppedEarly`), and when the program ends mid-count how many it took (`stepped`). `count` is
  clamped to 1..1000.
- Recording is opt-in and has a door. "Pyokka: Debug Current File (Recording)" sits next to the
  Debug button in the panel's title and in the palette; `"record": true` in a launch configuration
  and `pyokka debug FILE --record` are the same start: the Time Machine, the Code Story and `why`
  open over the run at every pause. A recording launch honours `args`, `cwd`, `env` and `python`
  (when the file's run-all session already runs in another interpreter the start is refused and
  names the session to stop first), and a `module` launch with `record: true` is refused, because
  a recording session needs a file.
- `skills/pyokka-debug/SKILL.md` is the skill for driving the live debugger: the phrase-to-command
  table ("break at rrf", "run to line 82", "set rank to 3 and carry on"), the `shell --live` loop,
  what an `exec` does to a bug report, and when a question needs `--record` instead.
  `skills/pyokka-agent/SKILL.md` stays the one for reading a recording and points at it;
  `AGENTS.md` names both.
- Every debug stop an agent gets carries the paused frame and what the program printed.
  `debug`, `continue`, `pause`, `step` at the frontier, `restart` and `context` all answer with
  the slice plus `paused`, `locals` and `output`, where before only `context` added the locals
  and the program's output was invisible: reading the frame cost a second `locals` call, and a
  print that explained the pause could not be seen at all. A session now keeps what the program
  printed in arrival order, the runtime's `print` entries and the raw writes it forwards, the
  last 64 KB of it, and a stop carries the last 4000 characters as `{text, truncated}`, redacted
  like every value. The text form prints the frame under `locals:` and the tail under `output
  (last N lines):`, the last 20 lines, 200 with `--scope`, and nothing when the program printed
  nothing.
- The exception pause, host side. A debug run sends `config.breakOnException`; the mode (`off`,
  `uncaught` by default, `raised`) is kept per session across runs and across Stop. The
  Breakpoints view gets the two standard checkboxes, Uncaught Exceptions ticked, and
  `exceptionInfo` fills VS Code's banner over the paused frame with the type and the message. The
  panel's header, the status bar and the CLI say `uncaught ValueError: too big: 3` or `raised
  ValueError: too big: 3` instead of a bare reason. An agent sets the mode with `pyokka break
  --live --on-exception off|uncaught|raised`, which reaches the run in flight at once; every
  `break` reply and `state.debug` report it, and the stop carries `exception: {type, message,
  uncaught}`. VS Code reports `filters: []` for a debug type it has not shown yet, so a filter
  list that arrives during configuration is only taken when it asks for something other than the
  declared default; a click in the Breakpoints view during a session always applies, and the view
  cannot be told about a mode set elsewhere. A `disconnect` that arrives after the run it
  belonged to has ended no longer turns debug mode off under a run that started in the meantime.
- A debug run stops where an exception is raised. `config.breakOnException` and the `debug`
  action `exceptions` take `off`, `uncaught` (the default) or `raised`. `uncaught` pauses on the
  exception that ends the run, before the `error` event, with the traceback's innermost user
  frame live: a frame that has returned still answers `f_locals`, so `evaluate` and `locals`
  show the values as they were when it raised. `raised` also pauses at the first sighting of
  every exception in a user file, before it unwinds, the only moment a handled one can be
  inspected. `debug.paused` carries `reason: "exception"` and `exception: {type, message,
  uncaught}`; its `step`, `rid`, `line` and `stack` point at the user statement that raised,
  which for a raise inside a library or C call is the statement that made the call.
  `StopIteration`, `GeneratorExit`, `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt` never pause, nor does a
  library frame; the mode can change while the program runs or is paused. After the pause the
  run ends as before: exit code 1 and the traceback.
- Hovers, watches, `eval` and completions run pure calls. `len(rows)`, `type(x)`,
  `sorted(d.keys())`, `d.get("k", 0)`, `s.lower().startswith("a")` and `[x * 2 for x in items]`
  answer from the finished run or the paused frame, where every call used to be refused and an
  agent re-ran the program to count a list. One module holds the rule for the three callers
  (`python/pyokka_runtime/pure.py`): the builtins in `PURE_BUILTINS`, still bound to the real
  builtin where the expression runs, and the non-mutating methods of an exact builtin type
  (`dict.get`, `list.count`, any public method of `str`, `tuple`, `range` and the other
  immutables). A user function, a method of a user object, `list.append`, `dict.pop`, a lambda,
  an await and the walrus are refused with one line naming what was refused and what is
  allowed. The receiver of a method call is evaluated once, and a program that rebinds `len`
  gets a refusal instead of a wrong answer. An attribute still runs a property and a subscript
  `__getitem__`, as they always did.
- The panel starts and stops the debugger. Its title shows a Debug button while no debug run
  exists (the command "Pyokka: Debug Current File"), and Stop Debugging now sits next to Continue
  and Pause instead of at the end of the row, where a narrow panel folded it into the overflow
  menu and it read as "cannot stop". The status bar's menu offers the same two. Both run the
  file to the first breakpoint, and to the end when there is none, like the command and F5.
- `pyokka shell --live [--session NAME] [--json]` runs many commands in one process: it reads one
  command line per stdin line, the one-shot words without `--live`, over a single bridge
  connection, and prints each result the way the one-shot command prints it, with a blank line
  after it; `--json` prints one JSON line per result and puts errors on stdout as `{"error",
  "hint"}` documents. A one-shot command costs about 70 ms, nearly all of it starting Python and
  importing the CLI, for an answer the session gives in 1 to 4 ms; measured against the e2e host,
  `state` costs 64 ms one-shot and 0.5 ms over the shell, `locals` 0.9 ms. `exit`, `quit` or the
  end of the input close it; `watch` is refused there because it streams until Ctrl-C.
- `pyokka stop --live` and `pyokka restart --live`: an agent can end a debug run or run it again
  from the top; the CLI had no word for either. `stop` leaves debug mode and stops the run, keeps
  the session and everything it recorded, and prints `stopped: exit N, K steps`; with no debug run
  in flight it prints `nothing to stop: ...` and exits 0 instead of failing. `restart` stops the
  run and starts a fresh one of the same file inside the same VS Code debug session, breakpoints
  and watches still in place, and prints its first stop the way `debug` does; with nothing in
  flight it starts one. The debug toolbar shares both ends: the adapter now answers the DAP
  `restart` request (`supportsRestartRequest`), so the Restart button replaces the run in place
  instead of VS Code terminating the session and relaunching it, which raced the old run's
  shutdown against the new one. Bridge requests `stop` and `restart` (`docs/PROTOCOL.md`).
- `pyokka debug --live` runs to the first breakpoint of the session's files, as F5 does, and
  pauses before the first statement only when no breakpoint can hit there. It used to pause at
  the first statement always, so an agent that had just set a breakpoint spent a `continue` to
  reach it and the person watching read "paused at demo.py:10 (start)". `--stop-on-entry`, on
  `debug` and on `restart`, asks for the entry pause anyway, which is where break-when watches
  and breakpoints go in before anything runs.
- `F5` with a breakpoint in the active file starts a debug run. Both Pyokka bindings on the key,
  Re-execute and Run to Active Line, now carry `!pyokka.activeFileHasBreakpoints`, so the key
  falls through to VS Code's Start Debugging and the `pyokka` configuration provider runs the
  file under the debugger to that breakpoint. Before, as soon as a session existed on the file,
  `F5` was a plain re-run that never paused, or a Time Machine move. Logpoints do not set the
  key: they are markers and never pause. The README lists the five states of `F5` under
  "Commands and keys".
- Starting a debug run leaves the Debug Console closed (`internalConsoleOptions: neverOpen`,
  filled in for a launch configuration that says nothing about it), so the Pyokka panel keeps
  its tab instead of vanishing behind the console on every start. Open the console when you want
  it (View: Debug Console); it evaluates in the paused frame with completion as before.
- A blank expression never reaches the run: `evaluateLive` and the DAP `evaluate` answer nothing
  for it, so an emptied watch field or a bare Enter in the Debug Console stops writing
  `evaluate "": SyntaxError` to the log.
- The Time Machine's watch machinery moved from `src/timeMachine/navigator.ts` (694 lines) into
  `src/timeMachine/watches.ts`: add, remove, edit and refresh, the Evaluate action, evaluation at
  the frontier and without a run, the variable-history cache and the panel's watch rows.
  `TimeMachine` keeps the same public methods as one-line delegates, so the panel, the bridge
  and the test API call what they called before; nothing else changed.
- Code Story: the document follows Quokka's own, rule for rule. `docs/design/code-story.md` is
  the contract, written from a probe of Quokka and the vendored frames, and the story is built to
  it. The code lens row, the zero-width fences and the blank rows between blocks are gone: row 1
  is empty, the blocks follow, and two blocks are separated by one row holding `…` and nothing
  else. A block lists the lines its pass ran plus two lines of source either side of them,
  clamped to the scope, with blank lines at the edges of that window dropped and an interior
  stretch of more than four lines the pass did not run folded to one `…` row. The header rule is
  gone: a function's `def` line is listed when it falls inside the window and not otherwise, so a
  first pass through a short function shows it and a later turn deep in a long body does not.
  Brightness is per step range, the columns the step covers against the rest of the line. Only
  the step the Time Machine stands at carries values, after the end of its line in the block that
  holds it, so the earlier turns of a loop stay clean; that step is boxed on its range and the
  story's cursor and scroll follow it. Stopping the Time Machine or the session closes the story
  instead of leaving a "session stopped" text behind. Hovering a name on a story row now answers
  with Value Peek's hover for it, taken from the row's source file and line; the value is the one
  as of the Time Machine's current step, which the hover's footer names. The editor-title
  contributions Quokka declares for its story scheme are mirrored for `pyokka-code-timeline`:
  while navigating, the story's title bar holds run back to line, back out, back into, back over,
  stop, over, into, out, run to line and the two breakpoint moves. They were generated already,
  gated on Quokka's previous-generation UI flag, which Pyokka maps to false, so none of them ever
  showed. The `[pyokka-story]` defaults now also turn off the editor's line numbers (every row
  carries its own), the glyph margin, folding and the minimap.
- Details: when a value is shown as a table and the document under it is empty, the table takes
  the pane; the empty editor no longer fills the rest with a focus box. Changing a
  `pyokka.story.*` setting refreshes an open story at once. The story's painted values are
  pinned by unit tests of the placement and filter rules and by an e2e case that reads them
  through the test API, so the per-pass values cannot quietly disappear again.
- `pyokka.story.values`: which values the Code Story paints. `all` (the default) is the
  per-pass painting from before the Quokka pass, each block carrying what its own steps logged,
  with a folded statement's value on the `…` row under it; `asOf` hides what the run has not
  reached yet; `step` is Quokka's rule, the current step's value only.
- Code Story grammar: each block is its own TextMate region (opened by the empty first row or a
  `…` row, closed by the next `…` row), so a context row that is the closing line of a docstring
  no longer swallows the rest of the document as one string; a row that is only a line number
  and a triple quote is coloured as a string edge without opening one.
- `pyokka story RUN --limit N` works. It was parsed and dropped, so every listing stopped at the
  built-in 150 lines whatever it said; it is now the line cap, and the head still reads
  `(showing S)` with the trailer naming the blocks it left out.

- The debugger (`docs/HANDOFF-debugger.md`, preview `docs/design/debugger-preview.html`).
  "Pyokka: Debug Current File" runs the file paused before its first statement; the pause is
  the frontier. Behind it the recording is the Time Machine's (values as of the step, Step
  Back, Code Story, Why); at it the frame is live: hover, Value Peek and watches evaluate in
  the paused frame with no re-run, STEP VARIABLES lists the frame's variables. Step Over, Into
  and Out execute at the frontier and replay behind it; Continue, Pause and Stop Debugging are
  commands, panel title buttons and toolbar buttons; Run to Active Line at the frontier is a
  one-shot breakpoint. Gutter breakpoints are the debugger's, conditions included, pushed to a
  run in flight; a `def` line pauses at every entry, a blank line moves to the next statement,
  a module not yet imported holds once it loads. Break-when watches pause when an expression's
  text changes or turns true (from the CLI for now). The panel marks the frontier on the strips
  with the hatched "not run yet" beyond it, says where the run is paused and why, and the status
  bar says the same. A paused run is off the timeout clock; an implicit re-run while a debug run
  is in flight is refused rather than killing it; a finished debug run is a normal finished run.
  Runtime: `config.debug`, `breakpoints` in the run request, the `debug` request (breakpoints,
  watches, pause, locals, continue, step), `debug.paused` / `debug.resumed` events, capability
  `debug` (`python/pyokka_runtime/debugger.py`, `control.py`); every pause flushes the recording
  so far. Agents: `pyokka debug`, `continue`, `pause`, `break`, `watches`, `locals` over the
  bridge (`--live`), `step --live` executes at the frontier, `context` / `state` / the `watch`
  stream report the pause, `eval` and `why` work at the stop; every stop moves the editor. The
  standard debug views: every start, the command, F5 with or without a
  `{"type": "pyokka", "request": "launch", "program": "${file}"}` launch configuration, or
  `pyokka debug --live` from an agent, opens a VS Code debug session through a DAP adapter over
  the same pause, with Variables, Watch, Call Stack, the Debug Console and hovers in the paused
  frame next to the panel; a file already shown in a debug session re-runs inside it; Stop in
  the toolbar stops the run and keeps the session; caller frames point at their `def` line.
  The command and F5 run to the first breakpoint, as VS Code's other debuggers do
  (`"stopOnEntry": true` in the configuration pauses before the first statement); `pyokka debug
  --live` pauses before the first statement so an agent sets its breakpoints before anything
  runs. Runtime: `config.stopOnEntry` (default true) next to `config.debug`.
- Watch expressions typed in the panel complete as you type: names in scope for a bare prefix,
  the object's attributes after a dot (no property runs while completing), from the paused
  frame while a debug run is paused and from the finished run otherwise; Up/Down choose, Tab or
  Enter accept, Escape closes the list. The + in the Watch expressions header adds one, double-click
  or the pencil edits one in place; Tab never leaves the field (with no list it asks for one) and
  a click elsewhere keeps the text, so a value can be copied mid-typing. VS Code's Watch pane and
  Debug Console get the same list in a debug session. Runtime: the `complete` request and
  capability (`python/pyokka_runtime/complete.py`). Outside Automatic mode a watch no longer
  answers "re-execute to evaluate": at the run's last step the finished program evaluates it,
  behind that a bare name comes from the recorded variables as of the step with a note saying
  where it was recorded, and only an expression nothing recorded at an earlier step says "not
  recorded at this step", with an Evaluate action in the row that runs the file once to record
  it there (no action while a debug run is paused: the frontier answers live).
- Values as a table, and why with a conclusion. A list of at least three dicts sharing their
  keys, or of tuples of one length, renders as a sortable table with a column per key, `None`
  and empty cells counted per column in the footer, nested values collapsed to `{n keys}` /
  `[n]`, in the Details pane and in STEP VARIABLES at the frontier; a "list" toggle returns to
  the tree. Two locals with the same value and container type show `= other`. The provenance
  tree (`pyokka why`, the bridge, the why pane) ends with a deterministic sentence or two built
  from recorded values: the arm of a conditional and its test, the call that returned the value,
  the name it copies, or the key missing from a container; empty when nothing was recorded.
- Clear Library Cache. "Pyokka: Clear Library Cache" (always in the palette) removes the
  instrumented library files under `~/.pyokka/cache`, or under the `PYOKKA_CACHE_DIR` the run
  child would see, and says how many files and bytes went. Only the `*.bin` entries at the top of
  the directory are touched and the directory stays, so a cache pointed at a shared folder loses
  nothing else; a file in use or read-only is counted and reported, not an error. Plain file
  operations under the user's home: no interpreter, no shell, no privileges. The CLI has the same
  as `pyokka cache` (directory, entries, size) and `pyokka cache --clear`, both with `--json`. The
  next run with library code on rewrites what it needs. The README's "unused for 30 days" for the
  sweep now says what the code does: entries not rewritten for 30 days.
- Execution Diagram: semantic zoom. The diagram opens at the level of the scopes: one card per
  module, function and package, the call edges between them, nothing else. A card's chevron opens
  that scope's statements and decisions on the canvas and the toolbar opens or folds them all; a
  call from a folded statement leaves the card instead, and calls that then share their ends merge
  with their counts added. Data edges are off until the toolbar (or `pyokka.diagram.dataEdges`)
  turns them on: they were the noisiest layer. The left pane gains a STORY tab, the run as an
  outline: modules, then phases (consecutive statements the source separates with a blank or a
  comment line, labelled by the comment above them or the names they assign), then statements,
  with the scopes a statement calls nested under it and referenced where they are called again; a
  click selects, moves the Time Machine and opens the scope on the canvas, and the row of the
  current step is highlighted and kept in view. The inspector lists every step the selected
  statement, decision or function ran at (the first 400) with the value logged there, the current
  one marked, and previous / next hit buttons; a statement inside a folded scope still shows its
  card. The graph is no longer built after every run: with `pyokka.diagram.build` at its default
  `onOpen` the host walks the run only when the view is open or opened, so a run costs nothing
  extra while the diagram is closed; `onRun` restores the old behaviour. `pyokka.diagram.detail`
  (`scopes`), `pyokka.diagram.dataEdges` (false) and `pyokka.diagram.phases` (true) set the
  defaults; the toolbar overrides them for the open panel and a change of the settings drops the
  overrides. `pyokka graph` and the bridge are unchanged: the phases and the hits are panel-only.
  The manifest generator's default for `pyokka.story.walkthrough` now matches package.json (false).
- Value Peek on locals without a run. Hovering a parameter or a local in On Save or On Demand
  mode answered "no value … Re-execute to evaluate", and re-executing changed nothing: the hover
  had queued no marker, and a function's locals are gone from the final state the finished child
  can evaluate. Now a bare name that nothing recorded at that spot is answered from the run's
  recorded variables when "Record Variable Changes" is on: the value as of the current step while
  the Time Machine navigates (the current call's or the module's), the last change otherwise, with
  a footer naming the step and function; Copy, Why and Add watch work on it. In On Save and On
  Demand a hover that still finds nothing places a hidden marker at the spot so the next save or
  Re-execute records it (the status bar reads "run needed"), names the function the local belongs
  to, and offers "Record variables and re-run": one click turns recording on for the session and
  runs once, after which every local at every step answers a hover. Hidden hover markers are never
  listed or painted; a session keeps at most 60.
- Fixed: on macOS, every run after the first of a file whose run initialises an Apple
  framework class died with SIGABRT and showed nothing: no values, no trace, no error, only
  `exit -6, 0 steps` in the log. Building an `httpx` client is enough (its proxy lookup goes
  through SystemConfiguration: `+[NSCharacterSet initialize]`), so was
  `urllib.request.getproxies()` (`+[NSNumber initialize]`) and a TLS handshake verified by
  `truststore`; the openai SDK does the first at construction, so HTTP Replay did not avoid
  it. `demo.py` never got there, which is why the suites passed. The runner forks a warm child
  per run and has threads after run 1 (the pipe readers, the waiter, the timeout timer), which
  arms Apple's fork-safety check in every later child.
  On macOS the runner now makes a fresh interpreter per run (spawn, as on Windows) instead of
  forking: about 35 ms more per run (interpreter start plus the runtime's imports; user
  imports were cold in the fork too) and no such rule. `PYOKKA_FORK=1` brings the warm fork
  back on macOS for whoever also sets `OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES` for the
  runner (its own threads never enter Objective-C, so Apple's check is a false positive
  there); `PYOKKA_SPAWN=1` still forces spawn everywhere. A run child that dies from a signal
  without reporting is now a `runner.error` naming the signal ("run child killed by SIGABRT
  (exit -6) before it finished …") with a hint, instead of an empty run; it is never re-run,
  the program may have had side effects. Also fixed in spawn mode (macOS now, Windows all
  along): the runner closed a dropped child's control pipe by descriptor number and the pipe
  object closed the same number again later, sometimes on the next child's pipe, so that
  child exited right after its run and hovers got "no finished run to evaluate against".

- Code Story: one block per pass through a scope instead of one per scope entry. A block now
  ends where a line comes back around, so a loop body is listed once per turn rather than
  folded into a single block for the whole loop, which is how Quokka's Code Story reads. Steps
  that share a line (a call and its arguments, a comprehension) stay in one block: only a line
  returned to after leaving it starts a new one. `blockBounds` and the Python `Trace.blocks`
  follow the same rule, so `pyokka story`, the context slice and the editor agree.
- The Code Story shows values. Each line carries what it logged **during that block's steps**,
  so the two turns of a loop show their own value rather than both showing the run's last one.
  The decorator still skips the story document; `CodeStory.renderValues` paints it, because only
  the story knows which pass a line belongs to. Unhandled errors land the same way, and the
  story repaints as entries stream in.
- Every Code Story block opens with a `…`, so one pass reads as separate from the last instead
  of being divided by whitespace.
- Code Story blocks carry context. A block lists two lines of source either side of what its
  pass ran, dimmed, so a turn of a loop reads in place instead of as two stranded lines; a run
  of more than four lines the block did not run folds to `…` instead. The line selection is a
  pure `storyBlockLines`, and the dim is a new `storyContext` decoration that applies whether or
  not the Time Machine is running. The context slice the bridge serves keeps listing only the
  lines that ran: padding is for reading, not for an agent's context window.
- The walkthrough at the top of the Code Story is off by default
  (`pyokka.story.walkthrough: false`). The story is source now, not narration; the walkthrough
  is still in the Output view, `pyokka walkthrough` and the bridge, and the setting turns it
  back on.

- HTTP view: the requests of a run, like a browser's Network tab. A new rail button (globe)
  opens an HTTP pane listing one row per request the run made: name, method, status, the
  statement that made the call (`file:line`, a click moves the Time Machine there), size, time
  and where the answer came from (live, recorded, replayed, or a miss). Rows appear while the
  run progresses; the footer sums them (`3 requests · 68 kB · 1.2 s`) and names the recording
  and its date; the pane's toolbar holds the HTTP mode dropdown and "Open recording" (also
  "Pyokka: Open HTTP Recording"). The table is filled for every run, HTTP Off included: the
  plugin now observes the clients in every run and writes nothing unless the mode is Record
  (`pyokka.httpObserve: false` leaves the clients untouched). While the mode is Record or
  Replay the status bar says so (`· HTTP replay`, `· HTTP record, 1 recorded`) and the rail
  button carries a badge, so a mode set an hour ago is visible before the next run; with the
  mode Off and a recording on disk the pane offers to replay it. Agents get the same table:
  `pyokka http run.json` (and `--live`, bridge `http`). Runtime: one `http.exchange` event per
  request, with the calling statement found by walking the frames at request start (right
  across worker threads and inside instrumented libraries), and `run.finished.http` for every
  run with the recording found for the file.
- Why is this value here: `pyokka why run.json STEP NAME` (also `--live`, where STEP defaults
  to the Time Machine's step) walks backwards from one value: the statement that made it, the
  names that statement read with the values they had and the statements that made those, five
  levels deep (`--depth`), the functions the statement called whose body was stepped with their
  arguments and result, and the calls it made that were not stepped (builtins, a dataclass
  constructor, library code) as leaves. On `example.py`, `why` on `total` shows the generator's
  input `acct` with its balance and the `Account("guest", 5)` it built. In the panel a "Why"
  button sits on every entry and on every row of the Variable pane, the hover has a Why link
  and "Pyokka: Why This Value" takes the name under the cursor; the tree opens in the Details
  pane, a line moves the Time Machine to its step. The bridge serves it as `why`. Runtime: the
  `bindings` reply also lists the calls each statement makes; a `# ?+` value (`autoExpand`)
  now counts as a recorded value for `var` and `why`. Protocol: "Provenance".
- Values as of this step. While the Time Machine navigates, an inline value is what its
  statement had produced by the current step: the current step's values in full, earlier ones
  dimmed, nothing yet for a statement that has not run, and `×2 3` on a loop line at its second
  pass instead of the run's last hit. Hovering a value or a name (Value Peek) shows that entry
  instead of evaluating, with a footer `as of step 27; final: 6` when the run ended with a
  different value and `not run yet as of step 5; final: 6` before the statement's first hit;
  only an expression that was never logged is still evaluated, and then the hover says the
  value is not this step's. `pyokka.timeMachine.inlineValues` keeps its modes: `dimOthers` (the
  default, above), `currentStep` (only the current step's values), `all` (every value
  unchanged). `demo.py` gains a three-pass loop to step through, and the e2e API gains
  `inlineValues(editor)`: what an editor paints.
- Swallowed-exception report. Generated code catches broadly, and the panel folded caught
  exceptions into the entries list where nobody saw them. The runtime now records where each
  caught exception was finally handled (`handledAt`: the `except` clause that matched, or the
  `with` whose `__exit__` swallowed it; a `finally`, a `with` cleanup or a handler that
  re-raises does not count) and aggregates repeats: one `error` event per exception type,
  raise site and handler, with `count`, the first and the last step. `pyokka exceptions
  run.json` (and `--live`; bridge request `exceptions`) lists one row per exception: uncaught
  first, then caught, each with the raise site, the handler, how many times, the first
  message; a row caught by a bare `except:` or an `except Exception` is flagged `broad
  handler`. The Output view shows the same list as an EXCEPTIONS section under the entries;
  clicking a row moves the Time Machine to the raising step. Exceptions raised and caught
  inside libraries stay out; one raised in a library and caught by the program is in. The
  uncaught exception is no longer also reported as caught (the instrumenter's own `finally`
  handled and re-raised it, and that counted).
- Value Peek: the hover's Explore value, Show as diagram and Copy links work after the file
  re-ran (On Save re-runs on every save). Each link now names the expression, its range and
  the session; a click whose entry id belongs to a replaced run re-evaluates the expression
  against the current run (a transient run in Automatic mode, the finished child's answer
  otherwise), and when nothing comes back the status bar says so instead of the panel opening
  on nothing.
- HTTP record and replay: a run of API-driven code can be repeated without the network.
  Settings gains "HTTP" (Off, Record, Replay; also `pyokka.http` and `--http record|replay`
  on `pyokka run`). Record lets every request through and writes each exchange (method, URL,
  headers without credentials, body, status, response headers, body or the streamed chunks)
  to `.pyokka/replay/<hash>.jsonl` in the workspace, one file per source file; Replay answers
  every request from that file, in recording order for identical requests, and never opens a
  connection, so editing the `print` lines of a file that calls an LLM and re-running costs
  nothing and shows the same values. Clients covered: httpx (and the `httpx2` fork the
  example venv ships), requests, and `urllib` / `http.client` as the fallback. A request with
  no recorded response is a `runner.error` ("run once in record mode") and a
  `ConnectionError` in the program. Bodies and header values pass through the secret
  masking; `authorization`, `cookie` and other secret-named headers are never written. The
  status bar reads "replayed" (or "recorded N") after the duration and `run.finished`
  carries `replayed` and `http`; the first recording in a git workspace offers once to add
  `.pyokka/replay/` to `.gitignore`. Plugins gain an `after(config)` hook whose result is
  merged into `run.finished`, plus `execute.current` and `execute.runner_error`.
- Execution diagram: the run as a picture. `pyokka graph run.json` (and `--live`) lists the
  nodes and edges of a run: the module, one node per user function that ran with its call
  count, its first call's arguments and result (`in amount = 30 · out 55.5`) and what it
  raised, one collapsed node per library package (`--all` or `--expand PKG` unrolls it),
  every decision under the function it lives in with the arm it took and the first line of
  the arm that never ran, one call edge per caller and callee with the count and the call
  steps, tool edges for library callbacks, and data edges where a value one function
  produced went into another (labelled with the parameter). `--dot` prints Graphviz. The
  same graph is the panel's Execution Diagram view ("Pyokka: Show Execution Diagram", the
  rail's More menu, the Time Machine toolbar): the canvas, a step scrubber under it that
  moves the Time Machine (and follows it), the walkthrough list on the left, the inspector
  on the right with the selected node's rows and calls and what is running now; the call
  stack at the current step is highlighted, nodes not yet entered are dimmed, finished ones
  ticked; clicking a node jumps to its first call, clicking a package node unrolls it. The
  bridge serves it as `graph`. Deterministic, no model; 200 nodes at most.
- Execution diagram, statements: a script that calls into libraries (a module with no
  functions of its own) drew as one box. Every simple statement a step ran is now a node
  under the module or function it lives in, chained in run order: its source, how many
  times it ran, the value it logged, what it printed, what it raised, the names it assigns
  and reads. Call edges leave from the statement that made the call, and data edges join
  the statement that last assigned a name to the statements and decisions that read it,
  so `client = OpenAI(…)` ⇢ `response = client.responses.parse(…)` ⇢ `dt = parser.parse(…)`
  ⇢ the loop ⇢ the `if` reads as a pipeline. The scrubber highlights the running statement.
  `pyokka graph --no-statements` (bridge: `statements: false`) keeps the function-level picture.
- Execution diagram, layout: each module and function is one column segment (its card on
  top, its statements and decisions stacked under it, a faint frame around them that selects
  the scope when clicked), columns by call depth, a callee beside the statement that first
  calls it, call edges leaving that statement along its row, data edges as arcs on the left
  of the chain. A script with many calls no longer fans out into a strip that fits small; the
  fit keeps a readable scale and the fit button fits the width and aligns the top so a long
  script reads from its first statement.
- Walkthrough: what happened, in order. `pyokka walkthrough run.json` (and `--live`) lists
  one moment per line with its step number and the values that mattered: the module start,
  every call with its arguments and return value (library calls merged into one line per
  call site: "call to OpenAI.__init__ (openai) from <module>, 3 nested calls", `--all` for
  each), every `if`/`elif`/`match` with the arm it took, loops with their iteration count,
  logged values, prints, every exception with where it was handled, and the end with the
  exit code. Deterministic and instant, no model. `--from N --to M`, `--scope NAME` and
  `--file F` select a window; 400 moments otherwise, repeated calls collapsed. The same
  list is the WALKTHROUGH section of the Output view (clicking a moment moves the Time
  Machine there, the active moment follows the current step, past ones dim) and the top of
  the Code Story (`pyokka.story.walkthrough`). The bridge serves it as `walkthrough`.
- Narrate: one model call adds a sentence of gloss per moment, never automatically. `pyokka
  narrate run.json` writes the glosses into the saved run; the WALKTHROUGH section's Narrate
  button (and "Pyokka: Narrate Walkthrough") does the same for the open session, cached per
  run. The backend is `pyokka.explain.command` when set, else `claude -p` when it is on the
  PATH, else `codex exec`, else Copilot's models inside VS Code; values and source are
  redacted before they leave; a bad answer keeps the glosses empty and says why once.
- Coroutines and tasks: a scope's parent is now the frame that called, awaited or iterated
  it, read from the caller's frame, instead of whichever scope last recorded a step. Tasks
  gathered by `asyncio.gather` used to nest under each other as they interleaved (a `fetch`
  of one task at depth 5 under the other task's `fetch`), which put wrong frames in the call
  stack and made Step Over hop between tasks. Each task now sits under the module at depth 1
  with its own calls beneath it, and Step Over / Step Out (and their back variants, in the
  panel and in `pyokka step`) follow the scope's parent chain rather than step depth: from
  `both = await asyncio.gather(turn(2), turn(3))` Step Over lands on the next statement of
  the awaiting coroutine. The same rule stops Step Over inside `f` from landing on a sibling
  call `g` made from the same line.
- Variable history: "where does `dt` come from?" answered from the run. `pyokka var run.json
  NAME [--file F] [--scope NAME]` (also `--live`) lists every step where a name changed, with
  the statement (`file:line`, function), the new value and, after `←`, the names the statement
  read with their values at that moment, so one more `var` walks a step further back. A
  "VARIABLE" pane in the panel (rail button, or "Pyokka: Show Variable History" on the name
  under the cursor) shows the same list; a row moves the Time Machine to its step, a read name
  becomes the next query. Names match as paths: `acct` lists `acct.deposit(amount)` and
  `acct.balance`, `self.balance` lists `self`. Three sources: recorded locals (the new
  per-session "Record Variable Changes" toggle in Settings, off by default; `pyokka run --save`
  records them), logged values under the name (`# ?`, Auto Log, identifier statements), and the
  statements that assign the name from the AST when nothing recorded the value, marked
  "assigned here (value not recorded)", or "(unchanged)" with the value the statement left as
  it was when the following step observed no change. Runtime: a stateless `bindings` request
  (what each statement assigns and reads) serves the extension; the CLI parses the sources it
  has. Protocol: "Variable history" and the bridge's `var`.
- Run Timeout is a session setting in the panel (Settings view, next to the run mode: 30 s to
  10 min or no limit; "Save as defaults" writes `pyokka.runTimeout`). The timeout is wall
  time for the whole run, waiting on the network included, so an agent script that makes a
  few LLM calls dies at the default 30 s. When that happens the entries pane now says so:
  the values stop where the run was killed, nothing can be expanded or evaluated until the
  next run, and a link opens Settings. Before, the only trace was the status-bar tooltip and
  expanding a value silently did nothing.
- Time Machine: every block on the Steps strip carries its step number (`#23`, the number
  the `pyokka` CLI prints) above the `line:col` label, so a step an agent names can be found
  on the strip. The code preview hover leads with the step number and function and, for a
  step inside a call, says which step and line called it (`called from #22 <module> line
  84`): a factory lambda that runs during a constructor no longer looks like a jump. The call
  stack rows show the step of each frame too.
- The default run mode is On Save for every file, scratch files included (it was smart:
  automatic for scratch files, on save inside a project). Automatic and smart remain
  selectable per session and in `pyokka.runMode`. `examples/` pins Automatic in its workspace
  settings so the demo and the e2e suite keep running on edit.
- The run-mode dropdown in Settings opens its list instead of a clipped 2 px strip.
- The panel never writes the run mode to the user settings any more. "Save as defaults" and
  the earlier settings view wrote `pyokka.runMode: "auto"` globally, which turned every
  project file into an automatic session: a hover re-ran the file, and for a file that calls
  an API each hover was a paid run. The run mode stays per session; new files get the smart
  default. Check your user settings for a leftover `pyokka.runMode` and remove it.
- Agent access: a `pyokka` CLI (stdlib argparse, `uvx --from ./python pyokka`) lets an agent
  read a recorded run the way the Time Machine does. `pyokka run FILE --save run.json
  [--library-code] [--keep]` saves the events with file hashes; `story`, `steps`, `step N
  --into|--over|--out|--back|--back-over|--back-out|--to`, `context`, `values --line`, `find`,
  `eval`, `expand` answer from it with bounded text or `--json`, every stop as one "context
  slice" (location, call stack, the enclosing block's lines that ran, values, coverage, the
  step each move would reach). `--keep` keeps the finished process alive for `eval`/`expand`.
  Secret-looking values are redacted before anything leaves the runtime.
- Agent access in VS Code: with `pyokka.agentAccess` on (default off) each session listens on
  a local Unix socket with a token (`~/.pyokka/sessions/`); `step` moves the editor, `watch`
  streams the user's own steps, `eval`/`expand` reach the finished run. The CLI's `--live`
  talks to it so an agent can step while you watch, in the chat you already use.
- Fixed: statements of imported modules were all positioned on line 1 by the module-scope
  wrapper, so error stacks and tracebacks inside imported project or library code reported
  line 1 (the library cache format is bumped, entries are rebuilt). Fixed: recording locals
  could re-enter instrumented `__repr__`/`__getattr__` (a pydantic model produced 640 k phantom
  steps); reprs run quiet now.
- Secrets are masked in the run process (`pyokka.secrets.mask`, on by default; a "Mask Secrets"
  session toggle in Settings). No value-shape guessing: the value of any environment variable
  with a secret-looking name is replaced wherever it appears (reprs, prints, exceptions, URLs,
  hovers, watches, locals; `load_dotenv()` variables included), and a string under a
  secret-looking name (`api_key`, `password`, `token=` in a repr) is replaced whatever it is.
  `pyokka.secrets.names` adds words. The panel renders the mask blurred; the editor, the panel
  and the extension logs never receive the value. Protocol: `config.secrets`, value node `secret`.
- Rendered panel tests (`test/unit/webview/chrome.test.tsx`, via `preact-render-to-string`):
  rail icon order and tooltips per state, the running spinner, the Time Machine button while
  navigating, the toolbar stop button, the Settings view contents, the entries empty text.
- One Settings in the panel, at the bottom of the rail: the view shows the current session's
  settings and run mode, every change applies immediately, and a save button makes the
  current values the defaults for new files. The separate "Session settings" quick menu
  that duplicated the toggles is gone; View Recent Files sits in the Settings header and the
  More menu.
- "Pyokka: Start on Current File" is always in the command palette. It was hidden whenever
  VS Code had no active-editor context (focus in the panel, no editor open), and it opens a
  new Python file in that case anyway.
- The rail's Time Machine button is a clock-arrow icon that starts the Time Machine or, while
  navigating, brings its view back (it was a plain grey stop square, and the only way back from
  Output or Settings was to stop). Stopping is the red square in the Time Machine toolbar
  (or Shift+F5). The panel also forgets a previous session's Time Machine state when it
  re-binds, and stopping a session stops its Time Machine.
- Panel tooltips appear after 150 ms instead of the second a native webview tooltip takes,
  positioned next to the icon (left of the rail), so the rail's icons can be told apart.
- The rail's play button spins while a run is in flight and the entries pane says
  "RUNNING…" instead of "NO LOGS OR ERRORS" (a click while running restarts the run).
- Code Story reads project and library modules that are not open in an editor from disk,
  instead of printing "(no source available)" for every library block.
- `test/e2e/libdiag.test.js` (`./node_modules/.bin/vscode-test --config .vscode-test.libdiag.mjs`)
  replays the library-code sequence against the example venv with timings and an
  event-loop lag monitor; it skips when that venv is absent.
- Library stepping is fast enough to leave on. Importing `openai` with every package
  instrumented took 17 s (1.7 M steps, 121 MB of trace deltas, and the 30 s timeout could
  kill the child mid-write); it now takes 2.5 s on the first run and 0.8 s after that,
  `libraryPackages: ["openai"]` 0.7 s, against 0.6 s with the option off
  (`scripts/measure-library-run.py`). What changed:
  - A library module's import-time execution is coverage-only: statements it runs while
    importing, and the functions they call, count as covered but record no steps, scopes
    or handled exceptions (pydantic building its models is not code you stepped into).
    Library functions called from your code are stepped as before.
  - Instrumented library files are cached under `~/.pyokka/cache/` (`PYOKKA_CACHE_DIR`
    overrides the directory, empty disables the cache); entries are keyed by the file's
    path, mtime and size and rebased to each run's range ids.
  - `file.instrumented` no longer carries the instrumented source of library files; the
    new `source` runner request serves it on demand, and "Show Instrumented File" shows
    the active editor's file when the last run instrumented it.
  - Mid-run trace deltas send only the scopes created since the previous delta, none are
    sent past `maxTraceSteps`, and no scopes are created past the cap either.
  - Instrumentation time is added to the run's timeout deadline, the status bar counts
    files while a run instruments them, and a killed child's truncated last event line is
    dropped instead of reported as "bad event line from child".
- Step into library code, off by default: `pyokka.timeMachine.libraryCode` (or the
  session toggle "Step Into Library Code" in the panel menu and settings view)
  instruments third-party packages on import so Step Into enters them, with values,
  coverage and their own timeline colours; Step Out returns to the caller. The standard
  library is never instrumented. `pyokka.timeMachine.libraryPackages` narrows it to
  named packages or dotted globs. Takes effect on the next run. Library files report no
  handled exceptions and honour no `# ?` comments (that noise made pydantic unusable).
- Shadow values: in On Save / On Demand mode, editing a statement shows what it would
  print or evaluate to right away, computed from the data the last run captured (marked
  `≈`), without executing anything. `print(...)`, bare expressions and assignments are
  supported; anything with a call is left blank until the next run. Explore, Diagram
  and Copy work on hover values and shadow values (they are pinned into the panel).
- Inline values on lines edited since the last run are hidden until the next run (the
  old value described code that no longer exists); untouched lines keep their values.
- Hovering in On Save / On Demand mode now shows the expression's value from the last run
  without re-executing: the finished run's process stays alive and evaluates names,
  attributes, subscripts and operators against the final module state (new `evaluate`
  runner request; calls and comprehensions are refused). Explore, Show as diagram and
  Copy work on the result. Edit freely, hover to inspect captured data, save to run.
- The build timestamp is logged on activation and shown in the status bar tooltip, so a
  window still running an older extension host is easy to spot after a reinstall.
- A visible Run button: the editor title's run slot shows "Re-execute file" for a running
  Pyokka file (and "Start on Current File" for other Python files), the panel rail has a
  play button, and the "run needed" status bar item runs on click. F5 still works when
  the Time Machine is not navigating.
- Default run mode is now `smart`: scratch files run automatically, files inside a
  project (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.py`, a lock file, ...) run on
  save. A one-time notice explains each behaviour. Set `pyokka.runMode` to `auto` for
  the old default.
- Run modes On Save and On Demand now forbid every implicit execution: Value Peek
  hovers, watch expressions, Show Value markers, logpoint changes and the Time
  Machine's Auto Log no longer re-run the file in those modes. The request is queued,
  the status bar shows "run needed", hovers explain how to record values, and the
  next explicit run (Re-execute, save, restart) serves it. Previously a hover alone
  re-executed the file, side effects included. A one-time notice explains the
  Automatic mode's behaviour.
- Time Machine: `def` and `class` definitions no longer produce steps; after the
  module-level prints the next step is the first real statement, and Step Into
  goes to the constructor. Function entry on a *call* is still a step.
- Time Machine: statements in a class body (dataclass fields, class attributes) are
  coverage-only like the `class` statement itself, so stepping goes from the statement
  before the class straight to the first statement after it. Method bodies are still
  stepped when called.
- Time Machine: Auto Log is switched on while navigating (`pyokka.timeMachine.autoLog`,
  default on) so every step shows the value its statement produced, including
  `return` values inside functions.
- New setting `pyokka.timeMachine.inlineValues` (`dimOthers` | `currentStep` | `all`).
  The default keeps every inline value on screen while navigating and dims the ones
  that belong to other steps; `currentStep` is Quokka's behaviour.
- Spawn mode (Windows, or `PYOKKA_SPAWN=1`): the run child sends events with
  `socket.sendall` instead of `os.write` on the socket's file number, which is not a
  usable descriptor on Windows.
- Interpreter: "Select Python Interpreter for Pyokka" gains a Browse entry that opens a
  file dialog in the current file's folder, validates the choice, and saves it for the
  workspace (relative to the folder when the executable lives inside it) instead of
  globally. `pyokka.python.interpreter` accepts workspace-relative paths.
- Runs load `python.envFile` (default `${workspaceFolder}/.env`) into the child's
  environment, below explicit `env` settings, as the Python extension's debugger does.
- Packaging: the panel's codicon font and stylesheet are copied into `dist/webview/codicons`
  at build time; the installed extension showed missing-glyph boxes because they were
  loaded from `node_modules`, which the package excludes.
- Panel: the Call Stack toggle now lives only in the timeline guide toolbar (it was also
  in the panel title row and the webview header).
- Profiler: after the (uninstrumented) profile run the file is re-run normally, so
  inline values and coverage no longer disappear until the next edit; frames from
  Pyokka's own runtime are left out of the `.cpuprofile`.
- End-to-end suite: watches, edit-and-continue, logpoints, profile mode and snaps,
  plus a screenshot-driven UI pass (`PYOKKA_UI_PASS=1`) covering both themes.
- The Pyokka output channel logs the untrusted-workspace decision
  (`pyokka.untrustedWorkspaceBehavior`) whenever a session start hits the gate.
